* **Animation System**: The engine includes a built-in animation system, allowing for smooth and seamless transitions between animations.
* **Input Handling**: Avo Engine provides a simple and intuitive input handling system, making it easy to handle user input from various devices.
* **Lua Scripting**: The engine includes a built-in Lua scripting system, allowing developers to easily create game logic and scripts.
* **Performance**: Avo Engine is designed with performance in mind, using optimized algorithms and data structures to ensure fast and efficient rendering and simulation.
* **Ease of Use**: The engine is designed to be easy to use and integrate, with a simple and intuitive API and a comprehensive documentation.

**Components**

* **Model**: The model component represents a 3D model, including its geometry, materials, and animations.
* **Mesh**: The mesh component represents a 3D mesh, including its vertices, indices, and materials.
* **Material**: The material component represents a material, including its ambient, diffuse, and specular colors, as well as its shininess.
* **Body**: The body component represents a physics body, including its mass, position, and velocity.
* **Animation**: The animation component represents an animation, including its duration, start time, and mesh vertices.
